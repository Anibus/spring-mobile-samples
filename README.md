 - [lite-device-delegating-view-resolver-jc] - example showing view names adjusted based on device
 - [lite-device-delegating-view-resolver-xml] - example using XML based configuration, showing view names adjusted based on device 
 - [lite-device-delegating-view-resolver-jc-thymeleaf] - example showing view names adjusted based on device, integrated with Thymeleaf for view resolution
 - [lite-device-resolver] - Spring Boot application that illustrates DeviceResolver functionality and usage 
 - [lite-device-resolver-jc] - example using Java-based configuration
 - [lite-device-resolver-xml] - example using XML based configuration
 - [lite-site-preference-handler] - illustrates SitePreferenceHandler functionality
 - [lite-site-preference-handler-jc] - illustrates SitePreferenceHandler functionality
 - [lite-site-switcher-handler-jc-mdot] - illustrates SiteSwitcherHandler functionality using the 'mDot' strategy
