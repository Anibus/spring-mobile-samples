This sample app demonstrates Spring Mobile's WURFL integration, including:
- WURFL-based device resolution
- The WNG mobile view technology

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the application at http://localhost:8080/wurfl-showcase

Note: In order for the site switcher demonstration to work in a local test environment, you will need to add the following to your hosts file; for example, /etc/hosts on Unix and MacOS systems:
127.0.0.1    testdomain.com
127.0.0.1    m.testdomain.com
